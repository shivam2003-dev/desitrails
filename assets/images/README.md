# DesiTrails Images

Place legally licensed images here. Do NOT download directly from Google Images unless you own rights or the image is under a permissive license.

## Structure

- `assets/images/states/<state-slug>/hero.jpg`
- `assets/images/states/<state-slug>/routes/<days>.jpg` (e.g., `routes/4.jpg`)
- `assets/images/itineraries/<itinerary-id>/day-<n>-<i>.jpg` (e.g., `day-1-1.jpg`)

Pages will automatically use these files when present, and fall back to Unsplash queries when an image is missing.
